      ## Plan Creation and Iteration Guidelines

      ### 1. Plan Structure
      - **Plan files are stored** in `docs/plans/` under a directory named after the plan
      - **Split the plan** into a reasonable number of phases, each with a clear goal
      - **Use letters** to label each phase (e.g., Phase A, Phase B, etc.)
      - **Split phases** into deliverables, each with a clear goal
      - **Use numbers** to label each deliverable (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc)

      ### 2. Plan Updates
      - **Always update the plan file** with changes when iterating on a plan
      - **Provide a complete plan** with changes included, not just a statement of intent

      ### 3. Plan Approval
      - **Never begin implementing** a plan without explicit approval

      ### 4. Plan Documentation
      - **Use the format** "Phase A: [description of phase]" and "Deliverable 1: [description of deliverable]" to clearly outline the plan
      - **Include file names with directory** for every new file that the plan will create
      - **Provide representative examples** of code changes in the plan. You do not need to explicitly state every code change in the plan
      - **Update the package manifest** in the first deliverable step where the update is required if the project uses a package manifest

      ### 5. Updating Plan Progress
      - **Only add status updates** when updating plan status and progress. Do not change other contents of the plan


examples:
  - input: |
      # Incomplete plan without phases or deliverables
      Plan to improve project structure
    output: |
      # Complete plan with phases and deliverables
      Phase A: Improve project structure
      Deliverable 1: Organize files into appropriate directories

  - input: |
      # Plan update without new plan
      I will update the plan to include new features
    output: |
      # Plan update with new plan
      Updated Plan:
      Phase A: Implement new features
      Deliverable 1: Add feature X
